### Currently, I am working on my pet project 👉 [eScootie](http://escootie.net/) 🛴👈 (Coming soon!)
Being an electric scooter rider myself, I know how annoying cobblestones can be (they already cost me two mudguards...😔). This app is a community driven route planner (I need minions to input data 😏), that would avoid these mudguard killers. 

#### Development:
- Frontend running on javascript and react
- Backend is python and flask
- SQL database via SQL alchemy

#### Infrastructure
- Serverless infrastructure running on AWS
- Deployment using Github actions

## I have also written few articles on the basic concepts of OpenCV! Would love some feedback!
